# WPSyntax2CodeMirror
---
Simple library that allows WP-Syntax users to disable WP-Syntax in favor of a readonly CodeMirror editor.

## In Development
---
The demo page works. Clone the repo, run npm install and just open the `src/index.html` file in a browser.

I still need to add a webpack config that generates a release bundle. If anyone is interested in using this now, just
reference the index file for the style and script load order. The library is really small, located in `assets/js/wpsyntax2codemirror.js`.
